If I started another project similar to this one I would probably learn matter js much sooner

I completed everything in my needs to have folder

The hardest part of this project was probably breaking the wooden blocks this is due to it sometimes breaking 4 blocks at a time and it would not properly have the clickable area defined properly

I could not get sounds to work
