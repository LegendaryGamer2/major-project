## Advice to self if I do a project similar to this again
If I started another project similar to this one I would probably learn matter js much sooner

## Did I complete everything in my needs to have list
I completed everything in my needs to have list

## Hardest part of the project
The hardest part of this project was probably breaking the wooden blocks this is due to it sometimes breaking 4 blocks at a time and it would not properly have the clickable area defined properly
